      "\n",
      "### ✅ **Steps to Take:**\n",
      "1. **Contact the Instructor/Administrator Immediately:**\n",
      "   - **For academic courses:** Email the professor/instructor and the registrar or department admin. Ask:  \n",
      "     *\"Is late enrollment still possible? I'm willing to catch up on missed work.\"*\n",
      "   - **For online platforms (Coursera, Udemy, etc.):** Most allow self-paced enrollment—just join and start (check the course page).\n",
      "   - **For bootcamps/workshops:** Email the organizer—flexibility varies.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Explain Your Situation Briefly:**\n",
      "   - Mention *why* you’re interested and confirm you’re committed to catching up.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Ask Key Questions:**\n",
      "   - \"What’s the latest enrollment date?\"\n",
      "   - \"Are there fees for late registration?\"\n",
      "   - \"Can I access materials from earlier sessions?\"\n",
      "   - \"Are assignments/exams flexible for late enrollees?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "### ⚠️ **Important Considerations:**\n",
      "- **Deadlines Matter:** Colleges often have strict \"add/drop\" deadlines (usually 1–2 weeks after start). **Act now—you might have <48 hours.**\n",
      "- **Makeup Work:** You’ll need to review missed content quickly. Ask for syllabi/recordings.\n",
      "- **Fees:** Late enrollment may incur extra charges (e.g., $50–$100).\n",
      "- **Instructor Approval:** Some courses require professor consent for late adds.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 📊 **Likelihood of Approval:**\n",

      "| Bootcamps              | Low             | Cohort-based; strict start dates        |\n",
      "\n",
      "### 🚀 **Quick Tips:**\n",
      "- **Call** instead of emailing for faster response.\n",
      "- **Attend the next class** if permitted—show initiative.\n",
      "- **Check the institution’s website** for late enrollment policies.\n",
      "\n",

       "\"Based solely on the provided FAQ context, here's how to run Kafka components in specific scenarios:\\n\\n1.  **To run a Java Kafka producer/consumer/KStreams application from the terminal:**\\n    *   Navigate to the project directory.\\n    *   Run:\\n        ```bash\\n        java -cp build/libs/<jar_name>-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar:out src/main/java/org/example/JsonProducer.java\\n        ```\\n    *   (Replace `<jar_name>` with your actual JAR filename).\\n\\n2.  **To run Python Kafka scripts and avoid common issues:**\\n    *   **Resolve `Module “kafka” not found`:** Create and activate a virtual environment:\\n        ```bash\\n        python -m venv env          # Create (run once)\\n        source env/bin/activate      # Activate (Linux/MacOS)\\n        # OR env\\\\Scripts\\\\activate   # Activate (Windows)\\n        pip install -r ../requirements.txt  # Install dependencies\\n        ```\\n        Run your Python files (e.g., `producer.py`) within this activated environment. Remember to activate it each time. Deactivate with `deactivate`.\\n    *   **Resolve `./build.sh: Permission denied`:** Navigate to the directory containing `build.sh` (e.g., `/docker/spark`) and run:\\n        ```bash\\n        chmod +x build.sh\\n        ```\\n    *   **Resolve `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'kafka.vendor.six.moves'`:** Install the alternative library:\\n        ```bash\\n        pip install kafka-python-ng\\n        ```\\n\\n3.  **Ensure dependencies for supporting libraries (like dlt for DuckDB):**\\n    ```bash\\n    pip install dlt[duckdb]\\n    pip install duckdb\\n    ```\\n\\n**Important Note:** The context consistently mentions the **requirement to have Docker images up and running** before executing Python Kafka scripts. **This is the core step for running the Kafka infrastructure itself (brokers, Zookeeper).** The methods above are for running *client applications* (producers, consumers, processing code) that connect to a Kafka cluster assumed to be running (likely via Docker as per the context).\""
